h1. TarsosDSP

Is a collection of classes to do simple audio processing. It features 
an implementation of a percussion onset detector and two pitch detection
algorithms: Yin and the Mcleod Pitch method.
 
Its aim is to provide a simple interface to some audio (signal) processing
algorithms.

E.g. if you would want to detect pitch in a wav file:

AudioInputStream inputStream = AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(testFile);
AudioDispatcher dispatcher = new AudioDispatcher(inputStream,stepSize,overlap);
dispatcher.addAudioProcessor(new HighPass(startFrequency, sampleRate, overlap));
dispatcher.addAudioProcessor(new LowPassFS(stopFrequency, sampleRate, overlap));
dispatcher.addAudioProcessor(new FloatConverter(format));
dispatcher.addAudioProcessor(new WaveformWriter(format,stepSize, overlap, "filtered.wav"));
dispatcher.run();
