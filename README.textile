h1. TarsosDSP

TarsosDSP is a collection of classes to do simple audio processing. It features an implementation of a percussion onset detector and two pitch detection algorithms: Yin and the Mcleod Pitch method. 
 
Its aim is to provide a simple interface to some audio (signal) processing algorithms implemented in JAVA.

The following example filters a band of frequencies of an input file @testFile@. It keeps the frequencies form @startFrequency@ to @stopFrequency@. 

<pre>
<code>
AudioInputStream inputStream = AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(testFile);
AudioDispatcher dispatcher = new AudioDispatcher(inputStream,stepSize,overlap);
dispatcher.addAudioProcessor(new HighPass(startFrequency, sampleRate, overlap));
dispatcher.addAudioProcessor(new LowPassFS(stopFrequency, sampleRate, overlap));
dispatcher.addAudioProcessor(new FloatConverter(format));
dispatcher.addAudioProcessor(new WaveformWriter(format,stepSize, overlap, "filtered.wav"));
dispatcher.run();
</code>
</pre>

The source tree is divided in three directories: 
* @src@ contains the core class files. 
* @examples@ contains a couple of examples with a user interface. 
* @test@ contains unit tests.
